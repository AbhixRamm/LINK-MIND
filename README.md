# LINK MIND — Smart Link Organizer Chrome Extension

**LINK MIND** is a premium, modern, and privacy-focused Chrome Extension designed to help you save, organize, and auto-categorize your web links locally. Using Google Gemini 3.5 Flash, the extension intelligently auto-classifies saved pages based on their titles and URLs. It features an interactive, page-injected floating action button (FAB), a lightweight action popup, and a comprehensive analytics-driven dashboard.

## 🎨 Design System: Classy Obsidian & Ruby Red
LINK MIND features a bespoke, premium dark UI designed to be high-contrast yet elegant:
* **Backgrounds**: Obsidian Black (`#08080a`) and matte charcoal (`#0f0f12`, `#141418`).
* **Highlights & Accents**: Rich ruby red gradient (`#e52b2b` to `#990000`) and glowing drop-shadows.
* **Secondary Elements**: Soft metallic silvers (`#f3f4f6`) and light zinc/gray (`#a1a1aa`) for a clean, premium visual aesthetic.
